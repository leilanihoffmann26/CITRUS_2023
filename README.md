## Overview

This project explores the relationship between **economic inequality**, **climate change**, and **malaria incidence** across two countries: **Nigeria** and **Madagascar**. It investigates how economic and environmental variables interact to influence the burden of malaria and healthcare outcomes.

---

## Research Questions

- To what extent does economic inequality affect vulnerability to climate change-induced malaria outbreaks?  
- How do economic and climate factors jointly influence malaria incidence and healthcare costs across regions?

---

## Data Sources

- **Malaria Incidence**: World Health Organization (WHO)  
- **Economic Data (GDP)**: World Bank  
- **Climate Data (Temperature)**: Climate Change Knowledge Portal

---

## Tools & Libraries

- **Google Colab** (Python 3.9)  
  - `pandas`  
  - `NumPy`  
  - `SciPy` (`scipy.stats`)  
  - `Matplotlib`  
  - `Seaborn`

---

## Methods

- Collected 20+ years of data on malaria incidence, GDP, and average annual temperature for **Nigeria** and **Madagascar**  
- Conducted **correlation analysis** and **hypothesis testing** using `scipy.stats`  
- Visualized data with **heatmaps** and **line plots** using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`

---

## Key Findings

- **Malaria incidence increased more in Madagascar** than in Nigeria from 2002 to 2022  
- No statistically significant correlation was found between **GDP** changes and malaria incidence  
- **Temperature trends** did not significantly predict malaria cases across either country

---

## Conclusion

Although this study does not establish a definitive link between economic inequality and climate change-induced malaria outbreaks, it does show that **Madagascar has experienced a greater increase in malaria incidence** over the past 20 years compared to Nigeria. This suggests that localized factorsâ€”potentially including healthcare infrastructure, climate variability, or vector control effortsâ€”may play a critical role.

**Key Observations:**
- Heatmaps revealed country-specific trends in malaria incidence.  
- GDP may not be a sufficient standalone metric for economic inequalityâ€”future studies should explore alternative measures.

---

## Future Studies

To build on this analysis, future research could explore:
- Expanding the dataset to include **more country pairs** with contrasting GDP levels and similar climates  
- Studying the **availability and effectiveness of malaria prevention strategies** (e.g., bed nets, indoor spraying, vaccines)  
- Using **machine learning or deep learning models** to predict malaria incidence based on socioeconomic and climate features  
- Analyzing the **biological impact of rising temperatures on mosquito ecology**, including breeding sites, transmission rates, and life cycles
