Climate, Economic Inequality, and Malaria Incidence: A Comparative Analysis


Overview
This project explores the relationship between economic inequality, climate change, and malaria incidence across two countries: Nigeria and Madagascar. The guiding questions focus on how economic and environmental variables interact to influence the burden of malaria and healthcare outcomes.

Research Questions
To what extent does economic inequality affect vulnerability to climate change-induced malaria outbreaks?

How do economic and climate factors jointly influence malaria incidence and healthcare costs across regions?

Data Sources
Malaria Incidence: World Health Organization (WHO)

Economic Data (GDP): World Bank

Climate Data (Temperature): Climate Change Knowledge Portal

Tools & Libraries
Python

pandas

NumPy

SciPy (scipy.stats)

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Methods
Collected 20+ years of data on malaria incidence, GDP, and annual average temperature for Nigeria and Madagascar

Conducted correlation analysis and hypothesis testing to compare relationships between variables

Visualized trends using heatmaps and line plots to assess regional disparities

Key Findings
Significant difference in malaria incidence trends between Nigeria and Madagascar, with Madagascar showing a greater increase

No statistically significant correlation found between GDP changes and malaria incidence

Temperature did not appear to be a strong predictor of incidence trends in the datasets used

Limitations
Limited data granularity for regional economic inequality

Findings are correlative and do not imply causation

Further analysis with more disaggregated or longitudinal socioeconomic data is recommended

Conclusion
While the project did not find a conclusive link between economic growth and climate-induced malaria outbreaks, it highlights the importance of regional context in public health vulnerability. Madagascar has experienced a more pronounced increase in malaria incidence over the last two decades, warranting further investigation.
