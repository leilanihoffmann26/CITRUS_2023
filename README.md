## üìå Overview

This project explores the relationship between **economic inequality**, **climate change**, and **malaria incidence** across two countries: Nigeria and Madagascar. It investigates how economic and environmental variables interact to influence the burden of malaria and healthcare outcomes.

## ‚ùì Research Questions

- To what extent does economic inequality affect vulnerability to climate change-induced malaria outbreaks?  
- How do economic and climate factors jointly influence malaria incidence and healthcare costs across regions?

## üìä Data Sources

- **Malaria Incidence**: World Health Organization (WHO)  
- **Economic Data (GDP)**: World Bank  
- **Climate Data (Temperature)**: Climate Change Knowledge Portal

## üß∞ Tools & Libraries

- **Python 3.9**
  - `pandas`
  - `NumPy`
  - `SciPy` (`scipy.stats`)
  - `Matplotlib`
  - `Seaborn`
  - Jupyter Notebook

## üß™ Methods

- Collected 20+ years of data on malaria incidence, GDP, and average annual temperature for **Nigeria** and **Madagascar**
- Performed **correlation analysis** and **hypothesis testing** to assess variable relationships
- Visualized trends with **heatmaps** and **line plots** using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`

## üìà Key Findings

- **Malaria incidence has increased more in Madagascar** than in Nigeria over the last 20 years  
- **No statistically significant correlation** between changes in GDP and malaria incidence  
- **Temperature trends** did not show strong predictive power for malaria burden in either country

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Limited granularity in economic inequality data  
- Correlation ‚â† causation ‚Äî further research is needed  
- Findings are limited to two countries and a select group of variables

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

While a direct link between economic inequality and climate-driven malaria outbreaks was not found, this study highlights the **importance of regional context**. Madagascar's more pronounced increase in malaria incidence suggests the need for **targeted public health interventions** and more **nuanced economic-climate modeling**.
